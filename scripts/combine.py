# Usage input the bash style reg ex using (not including the *)  and this will combine all files together only including the header from the first one
# This is used to combine all the output files into one concatinated file.

ending=sys.argv[2]  # The second input is the ending of the files that you want to concatenate.

# Make a list of all the files in the input dir matching the description
csv_files=[] # doesn't have to be csv files anymore
for file in glob.glob("*"+ending): 
    csv_files.append(file)
print(csv_files)

# first file: write all the lines to the output file
